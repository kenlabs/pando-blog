# (Web3)Data NFTs & Data DAOs


While data and data analytics are undeniably important, many enterprises are becoming increasingly disillusioned with their efforts to capture value from it. Here is what they are missing: sustainable value creation is possible when data is exchanged – not just within a company, but beyond company boundaries in order to derive insights and effectively train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. 

Manufacturing companies, for example, could derive immense value from the inventory data of their suppliers. Similarly, banks can mitigate their risk of lending by viewing the transaction history of their borrowers. Brands can establish environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials for their products if suppliers share the requisite data with them.

There is enormous value to be realised in treating data as an asset - but doing so presents challenges as well. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a way to overcome these technological, regulatory and incentive-related barriers.

Once data is containerized as an NFT, enterprises can share these NFTs as an asset amongst themselves. Smart contracts can be used to automatically enforce processes and financial terms under which these NFTs are shared. Any transaction pertaining to a blockchain-based NFT is digitally signed and time-stamped, creating a secure and verifiable audit trail of the asset which the NFT represents. When data is converted into an NFT, its creation, modification, sharing, and consent can all be recorded, thus creating a verifiable audit trail that enables enterprises to comply with relevant regulations.
