# Use Cases


+ ML Ops data management system
  + Dataset for training
  + A base model for transfer learning of fine-tuning
  + Experiment output. Versioned by the timestamp of an experiment.
+ Data Coalition DAOs: empowers data ownership in the Web3 and Metaverse ecosystems and creates new market value for your versioning datasets.
+ NFT-based asset management: Seamlessly enable web3 gated access to your data by minting and listing Data NFTs on a peer-to-peer marketplace.
+ Dataset Preparation
  + Organizing datasets can be a hassle, especially as data is constantly evolving. JiaoziFS is the most suitable tool to organize the dataset. 
  + No need to transfer files with the existing content. Even if you rename or copy to a different folder. JiaoziFS knows they are the same content. It is common to move or keep the same images, videos when the dataset is evolving.
  + Version tagging. If there is a stable version of a dataset, we can tag a commit as the human-readable version.
+ Data Backup/Snapshot: Data backup is one of the most common requirements in different scenarios. JiaoziFS is a very simple tool to backup, or even snapshot, your data in the Web3 storage(IPFS/Filecoin).
